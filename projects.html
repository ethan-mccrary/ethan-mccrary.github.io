                            Discussed in this paper are several types of analysis done with MyDoom.A. The analysis
                            consisted of three parts: static, dynamic, and code analysis. For static analysis, a live
                            copy of the MyDoom.A virus was taken. From there, hash values were checked and the
                            executable was analyzed using hex editors. In dynamic analysis, MyDoom.A was ran in a
                            virtual environment. From this, accessed files and generated processes were observed. For
                            code analysis, the source code of myDoom.A was analyzed and several key functions used to
                            initiate MyDoom.A's attacks were recorded. This project is a demonstration of the skills and
                            techniques that were acquired in studying malware analysis.

                            This project is an Android app connected to an API. It allows the user to search through the

                            comipled together to give the user an idea as to how their meals will stack up. This app was
                            developed by myself and Tanner Jones.

                            consisted of three parts: static, dynamic, and code analysis. For static analysis, a live
                            copy of the MyDoom.A virus was taken. From there, hash values were checked and the
                            executable was analyzed using hex editors. In dynamic analysis, MyDoom.A was ran in a
                            virtual environment. From this, accessed files and generated processes were observed. For
                            code analysis, the source code of myDoom.A was analyzed and several key functions used to
                            initiate MyDoom.A's attacks were recorded. This project is a demonstration of the skills and
                            techniques that were acquired in studying malware analysis.
